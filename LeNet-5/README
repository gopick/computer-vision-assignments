== NUMPY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NETWORK ==

To run the LeNet, run driver.py using the command 'python driver.py'
Tweaking the number of examples on which it is trained, batch_size, epochs can be done in driver.py
This gives you the training error

You can also use the validation data as test data
For that comment out the lines 299 and 230 in LeNet_final.py and use the lines 232 and 233

All the functions that are required for the network are defined in LeNet_final.py


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KERAS IMPLEMENTATION

code is in keras_net.py
To run it 'python keras_net.py'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

t-SNE plots

The code snippet in tsne.py can be kept in driver.py and run it to obtain the t-SNE plots
1000 examples have been used to make the plots

There is no script to directly build these figures
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO RUN THE CODE THIS IS ESSENTIAL :

This doesn't have the data folder required(MNSIT) data.
Clone a repo using this command 'git clone https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning.git'

and use the data folder you get in this repository
