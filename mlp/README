The code can be run by the command: python driver.py

FEATURES :

1. user can specify the number of layers

2. user can specify the activation function for each layer

First experiments were done to calculate the hyperparameter value through cross validation. The data is present in data.csv


The main program code is present in mlp.py

you need numpy and matplotlib (pylot) installed
Different experiments were run and the plots are present in plots.pdf


the code structure and method naming is followed from http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ for easy readablitly and standard notation. And, all the required implementations for the assignment were done by me
